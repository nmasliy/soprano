				of Ukraine.</p>

			<p>6. SERVICE COST AND PAYMENT PROCEDURE</p>
			<p>6.1. The cost of services provided under this Agreement is determined based on their scope and the Executor's
				approved tariffs for services. Tariffs for services have the legal force of an agreement on an agreed price.</p>
			<p>6.2. The preliminary cost of services is indicated in the Treatment Plan and does not include the cost of
				treating hidden pathologies that may be detected during treatment. The coordination of the Treatment Plan and
				the cost of permanent orthopedic work is only carried out upon the complete completion of therapeutic, surgical,
				and orthodontic treatment.</p>
			<p>6.3. The prices indicated in the Treatment Plan are valid for the period specified in the Treatment Plan. After
				the expiration of this period, the cost of services is determined based on the rates of the Performer in effect
				at the time of providing the service.</p>
			<p>6.4. The services are paid by the Patient in one of the following ways chosen by the Patient:</p>
			<p>6.4.1. payment in cash at the Performer's cash desk;</p>
			<p>6.4.2. payment using a payment card using the payment device of the Performer's bank;</p>
			<p>6.4.3. payment of the Performer's bills by bank transfer.</p>
			<p>6.5. The services are paid by the Patient on the day of providing the service - before providing the service or
				directly after its provision, in the amount of the full cost of the provided service for a specific visit.</p>
			<p>6.6. The Patient has the right to make a prepayment for services. The cost of services paid by the Patient as a
				prepayment cannot be revised by the Performer in case of changes in tariffs for services and is established in
				accordance with the tariffs in effect on the day of payment. This rule applies if no more than three months have
				passed between the Patient's prepayment and the day the service is provided. Otherwise, a recalculation is made
				for the services in accordance with the tariffs of the Performer that are in effect at the time the service is
				provided.</p>
			<p>6.7. For certain types of services that involve preliminary expenses of the Performer (individual orders for
				implants, orthopedic, orthodontic, other dental constructions for the Patient from third parties, etc.), the
				Patient must make a prepayment in the amount of up to 70% of the cost of such constructions. The amount of the
				prepayment and the deadline for its payment are specified in the Treatment Plan and/or in the invoice, which is
				provided to the Patient in advance.</p>
			<p>6.8. Services provided by non-cash payment are provided on the condition of the Patient's prepayment of 100% of
				the total cost of services specified in the Treatment Plan. If the services specified in the Treatment Plan are
				provided in several visits, the Patient has the right to make prepayments for the services in parts, in the
				amount of 100% of the cost of the service that will be provided in a particular visit.</p>
			<p>6.9. If the total cost of all components provided in advance for the Service exceeds the amount of the
				Patient's advance payment, the difference must be paid by the Patient no later than the day after the provision
				of the Service is completed.</p>
			<p>6.10. In case of discrepancies in favor of an increase between the estimated cost of the Service (part of the
				Service) and the amount of the bill issued to the Patient for a specific visit, the Patient is obliged to pay
				the bill no later than the next day after the provision of the Service (part of the Service). In this case, the
				Patient must sign an Act of Services Rendered with a list of the Services provided and indicating the amount of
				the Patient's debt for the Services.</p>
			<p>6.11. In case of the Patient's lack of funds to pay for the received Services, the Patient's debt to the
				Performer can be formalized by an additional agreement on payment for the Services with deferred payments.</p>
			<p>6.12. The Patient may be given a discount on the cost of the Service, the size of which is determined in the
				manner established by the Performer.</p>
			<p>6.13. If there is a need to correct them during the provision of the Services (provision of additional services
				or changes in the Treatment Plan), the final cost of the Services under the Contract is subject to corresponding
				adjustments. The Parties agree on such changes before the provision of additional or changed Services. The
				Patient has the right to refuse the correction of the Services and continue to receive the Services according to
				the agreed Treatment Plan. If such refusal makes it impossible to continue providing the Services for medical
				reasons, the Performer has the right to unilaterally terminate this Agreement, and the Patient is obliged to pay
				for the cost of the Services actually received. If the Patient does not object to the change or addition to the
				Treatment Plan, the provision of the Services continues in accordance with the new conditions and with the
				signing of a new or additional Treatment Plan.</p>
			<p>6.14. If, due to the fault of the Performer, the Services are not provided in full, the cost of the undelivered
				and paid Services is reimbursed to the Patient within three working days from the moment the Patient applies to
				the Performer.</p>
			<p>6.15. In case of impossibility to provide services (part of services) due to the Patient's failure to appear
				for a doctor's appointment or for another medical procedure, the Patient's refusal to further receive services,
				violation of the terms of this Agreement and/or Rules, the Executor returns to the Patient the amount of
				prepayment made by him/her, minus the actual expenses and expenses for the manufacture (order) of dental
				structures for the Patient, within three business days from the moment the Patient filed the relevant
				application.</p>
			<p>6.16. The patient does not have the right to refuse to pay for the agreed and actually provided Services.</p>
			<p>6.17. In all cases where the cost of Services provided to the Patient is not directly determined by the
				Treatment Plan, including when the Services specified in the Treatment Plan are not fully provided, the cost of
				such Services (parts of the Services) is determined in accordance with the current rates of the Performer.</p>
			<p>6.18. The total cost of Services under this Agreement is determined by the total cost of all Services provided
				to the Patient.</p>
			<p>6.19. The terms of this section regarding the payment for Services do not apply to cases where medical services
				are provided to Patients paid for by insurers under medical insurance contracts or other third parties.</p>
