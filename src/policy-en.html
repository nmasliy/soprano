			<p><b>Personal entrepreneur Yuriy Yuriyovych Stetsiv</b> uses cookie technologies to offer you personalized

			<p>
				A cookie is a small text file that is downloaded to a device or read by a browser (such as a computer, laptop,
				or smartphone) when a user accesses certain websites.
			</p>

			<p>Almost every website uses cookie technology to optimize the design and functionality of the site. Cookies also
				make your interaction with websites safer and faster because they can remember your personal settings (such as
				login or language), sending information back to the website containing cookies or to another website to which it
				belongs (third-party cookies) when you revisit the website from the same device.</p>

			<p>They allow your browser or device to be uniquely and anonymously identified. <br>
				Cookie files cannot search your computer or infect it with viruses.</p>

				<li><i>Analytical and operational cookies</i> allow us to store information about how you use the website and
					how
					often
					you

					access to important information that interests you. These cookies are only used to improve the quality of the
					website.</li>

				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<b>According to the storage time:</b> <br>
				<li><i>Persistent cookie files.</i> They are stored in your device's web browser and are used each time you
					visit our
					site.
